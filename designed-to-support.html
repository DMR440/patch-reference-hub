        How these patches are commonly described in everyday wellness use — without medical or treatment claims.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        People typically explore these patches as part of a broader wellness routine rather than as a solution for specific conditions. The language around “support” refers to general wellness contexts such as maintaining daily energy, clarity, and balance.
